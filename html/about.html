    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Linear.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working on rocket-related simulations using the RocketCEA library in Python.</p>
    <p>RocketCEA is a Python wrapper for NASA's Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) program, which helps in calculating theoretical rocket performance parameters.</p>
    <p>Through these simulations, I'm learning about rocket propulsion systems, combustion chemistry, and performance optimization.</p>
    <p>For more details about my rocket simulation work, please visit my <a href="rocket_simulation.html">Rocket Simulation</a> page.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my page.</p>
